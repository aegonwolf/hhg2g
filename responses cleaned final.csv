I kept reading until I finished the series, and then I read it again. And again. It saved me, I think. It opened up the world again.

The strange, seemingly pointless journey of the book (which always turns off everyone I recommend the book to) makes it more accessible. You don’t take it seriously, so you keep reading. I couldn’t read “the classics” when I was deeply depressed. It took too much energy. Hitchhiker’s was easy, and cheerful, and made me think about things I hadn’t thought about in a long time.
